# Embeddings

Create an embedding for a string.
Train a neural net to decode the embedding into a string.

Have a neural net in the middle for embedding-to-embedding that gets decoded.
Embedding, here, is a representation of data that's an array of floats.

Have not tried to implement variable layer amount for pre-trained layers. etc
