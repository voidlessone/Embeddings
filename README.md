# Embeddings

Create an embedding for a string.
Train a neural net to decode the embedding into a string.

Have a neural net in the middle for embedding-to-embedding that gets decoded.
Embedding, here, is a representation of data that's an array of floats.

Have not tried to implement variable layer amount for pre-trained layers. etc

I used to be wristie, now I'm a shaolin.

I didn't like that USE has no decoder or ChatGPT. I wrote my own. I'm not wanted in any job not because I don't know how to code... my code is magic, I'm just a happenstantial shaolin. Try not to copy/paste for fear of invisible byttecode.

You can also forego the decoder and encoder and do straight data-to-data, the first and last layers would simply to the work of encoding and decoding. The neural net for transformation or what ever would be three layers in total at least.

Licensed patentable.

it should work idk
